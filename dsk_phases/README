phase 1: 

from sequences to super-kmers (in the DSK format)

phase 2:

from super-kmers (in DSK format) to counts 


note: currently requires the super-kmers to also contain additional metadata (number of partitions, superkmers per partition, etc), see end of phase1.


short example:

    ./phase1 -file [file.fastq]

    ./phase2 -file [basename(file.fastq)] -abundance-min [min_abundance]
